Welcome to the Chat Application Project!

This app is created so that multiple users can chat back and forth in a chat application.

To begin, download the repository. Make sure all components are included within it. This also includes everything in the BackEnd folder. Once downloaded, navigate to the Back End Folder. Here is where the backend of the project exists. Type "flask run" to begin running the server.

If flask does not run, type 'cd BackEnd' to bring up the folder.

Once the backend is working, in another terminal, type 'cd front-end-chat-server'.

To run the program, type npm start.
